## Micro/Nano-Systems

- Micro/Nano: basic unit is micron or nanometer
- Electro:MEMS have electrical components
- Mechanical:MEMS have mechanical parts
- System: Refer to integration of components

## Deformation of microcrystalline  grains

Grain boundary sliding (GBS)
- Grain boundary migration
- Recrystallization
- Diffusion flow
- Dislocation climb or glide
- Grain rotation
---
## Titanium Advantages

- Corrosion resistance
- High strength
- High melting point
- Non-toxic
- Low thermal expansion
- Easy to process
- Lightweight

## Amorphous Metallic Glasses (AMGs)

- Metallic Glasses : also known as metallic glass or glassy metal
- 如鋼鐵般堅硬，如塑膠般多變。
- High strength.
- High hardness.
- High tensile elongation.
Absence of grain boundary (晶界) and segregation (偏析).

## Microelectronics


## Technology Node

- Historically, the process node name referred to a number of different features of a transistor including the gate length.
- Technology node is the width of line that can be processed with a minimum width. No longer length of transistor is critical at 22nm, 14nm, 10nm and 7nm.
- In general, smaller node = smaller transistors.
