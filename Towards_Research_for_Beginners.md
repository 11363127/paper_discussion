## Research Features  
 
| Category      | Characteristic | Method |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| mathematicians      | usually care whether the problem has a solution or not       | Mathematical proof |
| computer scientists | typically work on the theoretical side of computation | Mathematical proof or analysis |
| computer engineers | typically propose a feasible solution to a practical problem | Experiment by simulation |

## How to Do Research?

- Re-search is a process of searching again and again.

**Process:**  
- Search for an interesting topic  
- Narrow down to an interesting problem  
- Survey all existing solutions  
- Propose a new solution or improve an old one  
- Show its efficiency or feasibility (theoretical analysis or experimental study)  
- Make a conclusion

## Problem Solving

- Propose an algorithm for the problem of interest
